What is Inehritance?

A process of creating a new class from an existing class

Inheriting attributes/properties/fields from a different class

Acquiring properties froma different class

Types of Inehritance
--------------------

1) Single Inheritance (parent has 1 child)
	class A {}
	class B extends A{}
2) Multi-level Inheritance
	class A {}
	class B extends A {}
	class C extends B {}
	
3) Multiple - Java does not support this

	class A {}
	claass B{}
	class C extends A,B {}
	! :  A class cannot extend more than 1 class
	
4) Hybrid Inheritance: JAVA does not support this
	Combination of multi- level and multiple
	
	class D{}
	class A {}
	claass B exends A{}
	class C extends B,D {}

5)Hierarchical Type - Java supports this
parent has more than 1 child

	class A{}
	class B extends A {
	}
	class C extends A{
	}
	
What is an abstract class?

- A class with  one or more abstract methods

- A class which has no complete implementation 

- An abstract class can have  and concrete methods

- If a class extends an abstract class it must override all abstract methods
defined in it's superclass

- Abstract class cannot be instantiated

	ex:
	
	Pet p1 = new Pet(); // error
